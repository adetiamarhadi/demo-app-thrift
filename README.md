# demo-app-thrift
application server using spring framework and apache thrift

- Java 17
- Spring Framework 6
- Apache Thrift 0.19.0

The intention of making this fun project will be developed to production grade.

- why spring framework not spring boot?
- why apache thrift not gRPC or even REST API?

IT'S CHALLENGING!!
